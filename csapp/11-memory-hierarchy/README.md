I/O bridge: a colletion of chips, Intel call it "chipset"



in old day: each track has same number of sectors --> track is more far from the center has bigger gap --> waste

the data size of a sector is always a power of two, and is almost always 512 bytes. 


seek time -> mechanical limits



logical disk block
“formatted capacity” and “maximum capacity”. some of those cylinders are reserved for failure


P 34
PCI bus:boradcast bus, only a single set of wire.Any device change the value of the wire, every device on that bus can see this value
PCI express:modern system.point to point

P 38
flash translation layer:firmware(like the disk controller on hard disk)


P 41
cpu cycle time:
before 2003: make cpu faster by double the clock frequency. decrease the feature size of the chip they are making ,put things closer
after 2003: processor design hit the power wall: power consumption is proportional to frequency (the higer the frequency, the more power you comsume)
2003 the processor that intel is ready to ship was going to burn 800W power with gigantic heat sink about 4 square inches
put more processor cores onto the chips
