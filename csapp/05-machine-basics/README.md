-why called x86?
> 8086,386,486... all end with "86"
- 386(1985):First 32 bit Intel processor , referred to as IA32
- Pentium 4E(2004):First 64-bit Intel x86 processor, referred to as x86-64, can also run 32-bit code
> some 32-bit program can't run on a 64-bit?why?
- Core 2(2006):First multi-core Intel processor

#### P6
- Architecture: (also ISA: instruction set architecture) The parts of a processor design that one needs to understand for writing assembly/machine code.
-- Examples: instruction set specification, registers

- Microarchitecture: Implementation of the architecture
-- Examples: cache sizes and core frequency

- Code Forms:
1. Machine Code: The byte-level programs that a processor executes
2. Assembly Code: A text representation of machine code
- Example ISAs:
1. Intel: x86, IA32, Itanium, x86-64
2. ARM: Used in almost all mobile phones
3. RISC V: New open-source ISA
